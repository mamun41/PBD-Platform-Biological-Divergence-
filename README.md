# Bulk RNA-seq versus single-cell RNA-seq cros-platform divergence and similarity analysis
Author: Md Mamunur Rashid

This repository contains a complete, manuscript-ready R pipeline for integrating bulk RNA-seq and pseudo-bulk (single-nucleus RNA-seq–derived) expression data.
The workflow systematically quantifies platform-driven technical bias, disentangles it from biological variation, and validates findings at the single-cell level.
The pipeline was developed and applied to human adipose tissue (hSAT and hVAT) data and is fully generalizable to other matched bulk–single-cell datasets.
