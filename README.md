# Bulk vs Pseudo-bulk RNA-seq Integration and Platform Bias Analysis
Author: Md Mamunur Rashid
> This repository contains a complete, manuscript-ready R pipeline for integrating bulk RNA-seq and pseudo-bulk (single-nucleus RNA-seq–derived) expression data.
The workflow systematically quantifies platform-driven technical bias, disentangles it from biological variation, and validates findings at the single-cell level.

The pipeline was developed and applied to human adipose tissue (hSAT and hVAT) data and is fully generalizable to other matched bulk–single-cell datasets.
